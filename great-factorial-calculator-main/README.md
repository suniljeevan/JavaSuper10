## Introduction
This is a simple java based calculator tool to get the factorial of a number.

## Prerequisites
Java 8+

## Usage
Compile and run the application to calculate the desired factorial, using below command.

## Strategies

### Array Based
This strategy holds a single long Array to hold the result where each cell denotes each digits of the result.<br>
Though this runs on single thread, yet has been recorded as the fastest calculating algorithm.

### String Based
This strategy also runs on single thread, but much slower than Array based.
